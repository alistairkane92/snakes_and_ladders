# snakes_and_ladders

Classic board game Snakes and Ladders modelled using OOP and tested with TDD.

This was a paired programming task given to us and completed in one day at CodeClan. It was challenging at first, particularly 
in visualising how the game was going to be played and how to move the player around the board.

Really enjoyed coding this game as a team and it is nice to see a working program (even if just on the console!)

Hoping to translate to Java and transform it into a dynamic android app in the near future.
